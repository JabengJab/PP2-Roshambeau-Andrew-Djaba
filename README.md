## Testing

I tested the project on an iphone12 and a Samsung Galaxy s8 and worked fine on both. I then went on to test on a Huawei tablet and also a Laptop with 15 inch display and it also worked fine. Also then went on to test on a desktop with no problems.

I also tested the project on [Bytes](https://bytes.dev/?s=amiresponsive) to see how it also displays. Screenshot is at the beginning of this readme.
